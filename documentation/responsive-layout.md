There are three responsive layouts:
- **"bigDesktop"** when the minimum width is 1220 (CSS) pixels
- **"smallDesktop"** when the width is between 475 and 1220 (CSS) pixels
- **"phone"** when the width is less than 475 (CSS) pixels

Responsive conditions are handled in JavaScript for more control over customizability.

**Directory:**
src > contexts > responsiveWindowContext.js

This context checks the width of the browser window and returns a string depending on the width.

The `index.js` file is already wrapped by this provider, so any component that needs this feature can import the provider directly.

**To "consume" the provider:**

1. Import:
    ```JavaScript
    import React, { useContext } from 'react';
    import { ResponsiveWindowContext } from '../../contexts/responsiveWindowContext';
    ```

2. Add the logic:
    ```JavaScript
    const windowDimension = useContext(ResponsiveWindowContext);
    ```
    It doesn't have to be named "windowDimension," but it's recommended for consistency.

3. To use the conditions, check the strings: "bigDesktop," "smallDesktop," and "phone," and apply the logic accordingly.
